## My process

- I began the Equalizer landing page challenge by cleaning up the index file and placing text in the right semantic tags to render the page correctly and also improve on the site SEO.

- I split up my CSS file & organised it into different separate files well known as partial files and imported all of them into one CSS file using a popular pattern known as the 7 - 1 pattern of file & folder structure.

- I finally wrote my CSS to get the web page layout looking as close to the figma design as possible, then alternated from the desktop view all the way to the mobile view

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS partials & imports
- BEM modal
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I managed to learn various advanced ways to control backgrounds with gradients, images & text.
